The Compreno Semantic Hierarchy is a part of the Compreno markup format. It is organized in the form of the tree, which consists of the semantic classes (SCs): the SCs are universal for all languages included in the hierarchy and denote semantic senses common for all languages; and lexical classes (LC): lexicon of different languages. 

Here we present a .csv table which contains the information needed to visually re-create the Semantic Hierarchy as a tree for exploration.
